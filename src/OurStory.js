     keep its shape through all of your poses.

     Women who lift - we see you. We know that you need durable athletic wear that will stay dry and stay
     out of your way during your workouts.

     Women who run - we see you. You need breathable clothing that can sustain the heat, the rain, the
     wind, and the snow. We've got you.

     With The Comp, your focus stays on your workout, not your clothing.
