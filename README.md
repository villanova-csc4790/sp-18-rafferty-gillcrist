For this project, we will be creating a site that is essentially a Yelp for women's athletic wear. We will have a MongoDB database that includes hard coded data for different projects and we plan to use node.js as a server and React as a framework. We intend to allow users to review pieces of athletic wear and compare said pieces from five different well-known companies, including Nike, Reebok, Athleta, Under Armour, and Lululemon.
